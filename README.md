## Development server
Run `npm install` then -
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/home`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Notes

* I didn't get time to build and custom validation i.e. no dates before today
* The booking form css jump when validation is invoked 
* It is responsive, albeit ugly on a mobile device
* The Options page could have loaded a lot more smoothly with a loading animation and then animating the content (imagine they're there)
* there is no favicon (only the Angular one)
* the image on /home is stored in assets rather than from blob
